# Custom Counter-Strike 2 Configuration


Before proceeding, look through the contents of the various configuration files to ensure nothing conflicts with your existing keybinds and settings and to understand what everything actually does before using it.   

If there's anything that conflicts, you can change the key it binds to, comment out the relevent lines, or delete them entirely.

An autoexec.cfg can have as many, or as little keybinds and settings as you want, and offers a variety of benefits; most notably more settings customization options than what the in-game interface provides.  

This configuration is separated into individual files to improve readability and to make it easier to find specific keybinds and settings.

## What is an autoexec.cfg file in Counter-Strike 2?

An autoexec.cfg file is type of configuration file that stores all your personal keybinds and settings for Counter-Strike 2.  

The "autoexec" in "autoexec.cfg" stands for “automatic execution”, which means the configuration is automatically executed whenever the game is launched.

## Installation

Copy all of the files from this repository except for "LAUNCH_OPTIONS.txt" and paste them into your Counter-Strike 2 configuration directory located here:   

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`   

Restart your game after doing so if it was open, otherwise launch Counter-Strike 2 and verify the configuration works as intended.   

If you're having trouble, you can reload the configuration by typing `exec autoexec` into the console.
